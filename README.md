# A Matlab Implementation of Neural Style Transfer
> Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an algorithm that creates an image by combining the stylistic features of a piece of artwork with the content features of a photograph. The defining characteristic of NST which sets it apart from other image stylization techniques is the use of Deep Neural Networks trained for image recognition. first derived in 2016 by Leon Gatys and Matthias Bethge, the algorthm uses a single neural network to extract and recombine the content of one image and the style of another.
